/*Exercise 4 (Function that prints only numbers 
that could be divided by a number given by the user)
*/


// C++ program to print all the numbers 
// divisible by the numbers provided by the user 
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Result function with N 
void result(int N) 
{      
    // iterate from 0 to N 
    for (int num = 0; num < N; num++) 
    {      
        // Short-circuit operator is used 
		// the number has to be bigger than 0, because we cant divide by a negative number
		// and the REMAINDER has to be 0, because we want an exact number
		// if not, we could put easily only that num has to be bigger than 0 and smaller than N
        if (num > 0 && num % N == 0) 
            cout << num << " "; 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver code 
int main() 
{      
    // input goes here, N=30, because that's the max number we are getting from the queue 
    int N = 30; 
      
    // Calling function 
    result(N); 
    return 0;
